#fast
Any old computer can hadle it to some extent.
Always be __responsive__, remove features before adding processing time.
_Automatically scaling_ configuration along with provided settings.
The server-client relation is retained tightly, ```cookies.js``` on both ends.

#beautiful
Source code must be short,  __readable__, and appealing to the eye.
Retain "politically correct" coding paradigms.
The final product must be _just as beautiful_ as the code.

#portable
This means modules must be either cut or packaged.
_Lightweight_, anything more than a few kilobytes is too much.
Can be distributed all together and modified easily for compatibility.


#elegant
Easy to use for a beginner.

Pleasing for an expert.

___Simple, vanilla, concise.___
