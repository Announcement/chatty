# chatty
A chat application able to deploy and reuse in any environment. 

# past
The project originated from a node.js http hosting application with a hand coded nosql database written from scratch.
Unfortunately, since I didn't even know what nosql was let alone optimizations at the time of original writing, the program was terribly slow.
It was being hosted on like a windows server 2003 with reboots as I was logged in at school on one machine handling 4 clients while the host only had 512MB of ram and a dual core cure2duo at like 1.2GHZ or something rediculous.
As people would try to type, the server would lag out and spam the same message anywhere from 1-6 times, anyways it sucked.

# present
I have some experience coding and know the modern paradigms, so I decided to revive the project and keep some of the cool features like the quick user account implimentation and keywork highlighting so we can still have fun with greentext.
The goal is to have the project as highly portable and fast on mediocre hardware as possible. 
A full featured, module based project is on it's way!
